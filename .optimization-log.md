---

### 2. Standardization Improvements

#### 2.1 Core Principles Added to All Agents
**Files Modified:**
- `agents/vertical-slicer/feature-backbone-specialist.md`
- `agents/vertical-slicer/step-analyzer-specialist.md`
- `agents/vertical-slicer/increment-generator-specialist.md`
- `agents/vertical-slicer/slice-composer-specialist.md`
- `agents/vertical-slicer/doc-slicer-generator.md`

**Added Section:**
```markdown
# CORE PRINCIPLES

Every [feature/step/increment/slice] must:
- Answer: "What would we ship if the deadline was tomorrow?"
- [Specific principles for each agent type]
- [Quality attributes relevant to that phase]
```

**Benefits:**
- Consistent philosophy across all agents
- Clear quality standards at each phase
- Reinforces radical vertical slicing mindset

---

#### 2.2 Troubleshooting Sections Added
**Files Modified:** All specialist agents

**Structure:**
```markdown
# TROUBLESHOOTING

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "[Common problem]"
**Solution:**
- [Specific action steps]
- [Alternative approaches]
- [When to escalate or redirect]
```

**Coverage:**
- **Feature Backbone:** 4 common issues (too few/many features, generic names, sequencing)
- **Step Analyzer:** 4 common issues (too few/many steps, missing quality attributes, overlap)
- **Increment Generator:** 4 common issues (increments too large, can't generate enough, no value, too similar)
- **Slice Composer:** 4 common issues (skeleton too complex, no user value, too many increments, priority conflicts)
- **Doc Generator:** 4 common issues (missing phases, inconsistent numbering, unclear selection, overwhelming docs)

---

### 3. Context Management Optimizations

#### 3.1 Orchestrator Context Bundle
**File:** `agents/vertical-slicer/vertical-slicer-orchestrator.md`

**Before:**
- Individual variables passed to each agent
- Redundant context in multiple places
- No validation before phase execution

**After:**
```javascript
{{core_context}} = {
  user_requirements,
  project_domain,
  business_objectives,
  technical_constraints,
  project_constraints
}
```

**Phase-specific enhancements:**
- Phase 1: core_context + user_personas
- Phase 2a: core_context + features_backbone_result + ux_expectations
- Phase 2b: core_context + features + steps
- Phase 3: core_context + ALL previous phases
- Phase 4: core_context + ALL previous phases

**Validation added:**
```
VALIDATE:
  ✓ user_requirements is not empty
  ✓ project_domain identified
  ✓ Previous phase dependencies met

PROVIDE DEFAULTS:
  - user_personas → "Not specified"
  - ux_expectations → "Standard usability"

FAIL FAST:
  ✗ Missing requirements → Request from user
  ✗ Invalid phase result → Re-execute with guidance
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced redundancy in context passing
- Early validation prevents wasted processing
- Clear default values for optional inputs
- Explicit fail-fast behavior

---

#### 3.2 Input Validation Added to Quick Slicer
**File:** `agents/vertical-slicer/quick-slicer.md`

**Added Step 0:** Input Validation & Scope Check (30 seconds)

**Validates:**
- ✓ ONE feature only (not multiple)
- ✓ Describable in 1-3 sentences
- ✓ Clear user value

**Scope Indicators:**
- Small: 3-4 steps → ✅ Perfect
- Medium: 5-7 steps → ✅ Good
- Large: 8+ steps → ❌ Use /vertical-slice

**Fail Fast Redirects:**
- Multiple features → `/vertical-slice` or `/analyze-features`
- Too vague → Request clarification
- Entire project → `/vertical-slice`

---

### 4. User Guidance Enhancements

#### 4.1 Decision Flowcharts Added to Commands
**Files Modified:**
- `.claude/commands/vertical-slice.md`
- `.claude/commands/quick-slice.md`

**Example (vertical-slice):**
```
START: What are you analyzing?
│
├─ Multiple features or complete project?
│  └─ YES → ✅ Use /vertical-slice
│     ├─ Time available: 30-60 minutes
│     ├─ Output: Comprehensive analysis
│     └─ Best for: Project planning
│
└─ Single feature only?
   └─ YES → ❌ Use /quick-slice instead
      ├─ Time: ~10 minutes
      └─ Best for: Rapid prototyping
```

**Added Anti-Patterns:**
- What NOT to use each command for
- Clear redirects to appropriate alternatives
- Time and scope expectations

**Benefits:**
- Faster command selection
- Reduced user confusion
- Clear time expectations
- Better command-to-task matching

---

#### 4.2 Enhanced Quality Criteria with Metrics
**Files Modified:** All specialist agents

**Before:**
```markdown
# QUALITY CRITERIA
- Steps are not too granular
```

**After:**
```markdown
# QUALITY CRITERIA
- Steps are neither too granular nor too broad
- 2-7 steps per feature typically
  (if < 2, may need decomposition; if > 7, may be too granular)
```

**Added Quantifiable Metrics:**
- Features: 3-15 per project
- Steps: 2-7 per feature
- Increments: 5-10 per step

**Benefits:**
- Clear success criteria
- Easier quality validation
- Objective assessment possible

---

### 5. Documentation & Template Improvements

- Generate pre-filled selection matrix
- Collapsible sections for long documents
- Quick reference generation option

**Improved Error Handling:**
