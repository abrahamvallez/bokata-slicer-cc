**Intelligent vertical slicing and feature decomposition for Claude Code** using the **Hamburger Method** and radical vertical slicing techniques.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

**Option 1: NPM (Node.js projects)**
```bash
npm install -D bokata-slicer-cc
npx bokata-slicer-cc install
```

**Option 2: Claude Code Plugin (any project)**
```
/plugin marketplace add abrahamvallez/bokata-slicer-cc
/plugin install bokata-slicer-cc
```

**Option 3: Global**
```bash
npm install -g bokata-slicer-cc
cd your-project
bokata-slicer-cc install
```

### Usage

Bokata v0.3.0 provides **three complementary commands** for different analysis needs:

**1. Project Analysis (multiple features):**
```
/bokata Project: E-commerce platform with catalog, cart, checkout, and orders
/bokata ./docs/project-requirements.md  # Can also read from file
```

**2. Single Feature Analysis:**
```
/bokata-feature Feature: Coach Records Audio
/bokata-feature ./docs/feature-spec.md  # Can also read from file
```

**3. Implementation Strategies (optional, after running /bokata or /bokata-feature):**
```
/bokata-iterations-paths  # Generates 3-5 implementation path options
```

**4. Selection Matrix (optional, after running /bokata or /bokata-feature):**
```
/bokata-matrix  # Generates complete increment matrix with dependencies
```

**Output:** Markdown documents in `./docs/slicing-analysis/`

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Start with project or feature analysis:**
   - Use `/bokata` for projects with multiple features
   - Use `/bokata-feature` for a single feature

2. **Optionally generate implementation strategies:**
   - Run `/bokata-iterations-paths` to see 3-5 different implementation approaches

3. **Optionally generate selection matrix:**
   - Run `/bokata-matrix` for complete dependency reference and custom path building

## üìñ What is Bokata Slicer CC?

Bokata Slicer CC automatically analyzes features or projects and generates:

**Core Analysis (/bokata or /bokata-feature):**
- ‚úÖ **Executive Summary** - Quick stats and metrics
- ‚úÖ **Feature Breakdown** - Complete steps and increments with dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Walking Skeleton** - The absolute minimum implementation
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Analysis** - What each increment requires and provides

**Optional Analysis (separate commands):**
- ‚úÖ **Implementation Paths** (/bokata-iterations-paths) - 3-5 strategic options
- ‚úÖ **Selection Matrix** (/bokata-matrix) - Complete increment catalog with dependencies

### No Estimations in Core Documents

**Important:** Core analysis documents (from `/bokata` and `/bokata-feature`) contain **NO effort/value/risk scores**. This is intentional:

- **Core documents focus on dependencies and compatibility** - What each increment needs and provides
- **Use `/bokata-iterations-paths`** for estimated timelines and implementation strategies
- **Use `/bokata-matrix`** for complete dependency reference and custom path building

This separation ensures core analysis remains clean and focused on deliverables, while strategic planning happens in dedicated commands.

### Feature Naming Convention

All features must follow the **Actor + Action** format for clarity and consistency:

**Format:** `[Actor] [Action]`

**Valid Actors:** User, Player, Coach, Admin, System, Customer, Manager, etc.

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ Good: "Coach Records Audio"
- ‚úÖ Good: "User Resets Password"
- ‚úÖ Good: "Admin Manages Users"
- ‚ùå Bad: "Audio Recording" (missing actor)
- ‚ùå Bad: "Password Reset Feature" (not actor-focused)
- ‚ùå Bad: "System for User Authentication" (too verbose)

This convention is **enforced by all commands** to maintain clarity throughout the analysis.

### Based on Augmented Coding Principles

As Kent Beck explains in ["Augmented Coding: Beyond the Vibes"](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/augmented-coding-beyond-the-vibes), this approach:

- **Prioritizes code quality** over simple system behavior
- **Maintains human control** while leveraging AI speed
- **Reduces "yak shaving"** (tedious setup work)
- **Enables more strategic programming decisions** per hour
- **Transforms programmers** into strategic architects

## üéØ How It Works

### Three Complementary Commands

Bokata v0.3.0 provides specialized commands for different analysis needs:

**1. `/bokata` - Project Analysis**
- Analyzes projects with multiple features
- Generates cross-feature Walking Skeleton
- Provides feature breakdown and dependencies
- No effort/value/risk scoring (dependencies only)

**2. `/bokata-feature` - Single Feature Analysis**
- Focused analysis of a single feature
- Generates feature-specific Walking Skeleton
- Detailed step and increment breakdown
- No effort/value/risk scoring (dependencies only)

**3. `/bokata-iterations-paths` - Implementation Strategies**
- Generates 3-5 implementation path options
- Includes estimated timelines
- Strategic recommendations based on priorities
- Run after `/bokata` or `/bokata-feature`

**4. `/bokata-matrix` - Selection Matrix**
- Complete increment catalog with dependencies
- Enables custom path building
- Detailed dependency reference
- Run after `/bokata` or `/bokata-feature`

### Analysis Workflow

**Step 1: Core Analysis (/bokata or /bokata-feature)**
1. **Feature Breakdown** - Identifies all features in user journey
2. **Steps Analysis** - Decomposes into UI ‚Üí Logic ‚Üí Data steps
3. **Increments Generation** - Creates 5-10 deployable increments per step
4. **Walking Skeleton** - Suggests absolute minimum implementation
5. **Dependency Analysis** - What each increment requires and provides

**Step 2: Optional Strategies (/bokata-iterations-paths)**
6. **Implementation Paths** - 3-5 options based on priorities
7. **Decision Framework** - How to choose the right path
8. **Timeline Estimates** - Realistic delivery expectations

**Step 3: Optional Matrix (/bokata-matrix)**
9. **Selection Matrix** - Complete increment catalog
10. **Dependency Reference** - Detailed compatibility information
11. **Custom Path Building** - Mix and match increments

### Example Output Structure

```markdown
# Feature Name - Vertical Slicing Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary
[Quick stats and metrics - NO ESTIMATES]

## 2. Feature Breakdown

```

---

## üîó Dependency and Compatibility System (NEW in v0.2.0)

Every increment now explicitly specifies its dependencies and compatibility:

### How It Works

**Each increment defines:**
```
REQUIRES:       What external dependencies it needs (or "None" for zero-dependency paths)
PROVIDES:       Capabilities it offers to other steps
COMPATIBLE WITH: Which increments from other steps it works with
```

### What This Enables

‚úÖ **Guaranteed Deployable Paths** - Walking Skeleton is always a valid, complete E2E flow
‚úÖ **Coordinated Increments** - All selected increments work together seamlessly
‚úÖ **Multiple Valid Options** - Several implementation paths automatically identified
‚úÖ **Transparent Dependencies** - Clear visibility of what each increment needs
‚úÖ **Automatic Validation** - Incompatible combinations are detected and flagged

### Example

```markdown
Step 1: UI Form
| Increment | Requires | Provides | Compatible With |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| 1.1 Form (client) | None | User input | 2.1, 3.1 |
| 1.2 Form (API) | POST /api/save | HTTP request | 2.2, 2.3 |

Step 2: Backend
| Increment | Requires | Provides | Compatible With |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| 2.1 None | None | Nothing | 1.1, 3.1 |
| 2.2 API endpoint | Database | POST /api/save | 1.2, 3.2 |

Step 3: Storage
| Increment | Requires | Provides | Compatible With |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| 3.1 localStorage | None | Persistence | 1.1, 2.1 |
| 3.2 Supabase | Backend ready | Database | 1.2, 2.2 |

‚úÖ Valid Paths:
- 1.1 + 2.1 + 3.1 (all client-side, zero dependencies)
- 1.2 + 2.2 + 3.2 (API + database, coordinated)
```

## üéì Methodology

### Hamburger Method

Every slice must:
- ‚úÖ Answer: **"What would we ship if the deadline was tomorrow?"**
- ‚úÖ Cut through all technical layers (UI ‚Üí Logic ‚Üí Data)
- ‚úÖ Deliver real, observable value to the user
- ‚úÖ Build the smallest that works, not the "best" version first
- ‚úÖ Can be deployed independently
- ‚úÖ Enable early feedback

### Breakdown Strategies

20+ strategies including:
- Start with outputs - Begin with visible results
- Zero/One/Many progression - Hardcode ‚Üí single ‚Üí multiple
- Dummy to dynamic - Static ‚Üí configurable ‚Üí dynamic
- Workflow simplification - Skip optional steps
- User segment narrowing - Target specific user type
- Capacity-based splitting - Limit initial capacity
- Extract basic utility - Core functionality only
- Defer edge cases - Handle happy path first
- Manual before automated - Automation comes later
- And more...

**Note:** These strategies are applied during increment generation in core analysis. Timeline estimates are only provided in the `/bokata-iterations-paths` output.
