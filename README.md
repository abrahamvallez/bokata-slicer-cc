**Intelligent vertical slicing and feature decomposition for Claude Code** using the **Hamburger Method** and radical vertical slicing techniques.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

**Option 1: NPM (Node.js projects)**
```bash
npm install -D increments-slicer
npx increments-slicer install
```

**Option 2: Claude Code Plugin (any project)**
```
/plugin marketplace add abrahamvallez/increments-slicer
/plugin install increments-slicer
```

**Option 3: Global**
```bash
npm install -g increments-slicer
cd your-project
increments-slicer install
```

### Usage

**Analyze a single feature (default - core analysis):**
```
/slice Feature: User can reset their password via email
```

**With implementation paths:**
```
/slice --with-paths Feature: Password reset
```

**Full analysis (all sections):**
```
/slice --full Feature: Password reset
```

**Analyze a full project:**
```
/slice Project: E-commerce platform with catalog, cart, checkout, and orders
/slice --full Project: E-commerce platform  # Complete analysis
```

**Output:** Markdown document in `./docs/slicing-analysis/`

## üìñ What is Increments Slicer?

Increments Slicer automatically analyzes features or projects and generates:

**Core Analysis (always included):**
- ‚úÖ **Executive Summary** - Quick stats and metrics
- ‚úÖ **Feature Breakdown** - Complete steps and increments
- ‚úÖ **Walking Skeleton** - The absolute minimum implementation
- ‚úÖ **Selection Matrix** - Complete increment catalog with scoring

**Optional Sections (with flags):**
- ‚úÖ **Implementation Paths** (--with-paths) - 3-5 options based on priorities
- ‚úÖ **Decision Guide** (--with-guide) - Framework for choosing paths
- ‚úÖ **Next Steps** (--full) - Actionable guidance

### Based on Augmented Coding Principles

As Kent Beck explains in ["Augmented Coding: Beyond the Vibes"](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/augmented-coding-beyond-the-vibes), this approach:

- **Prioritizes code quality** over simple system behavior
- **Maintains human control** while leveraging AI speed
- **Reduces "yak shaving"** (tedious setup work)
- **Enables more strategic programming decisions** per hour
- **Transforms programmers** into strategic architects

---

## üéØ How It Works

### Single Command, Intelligent Detection

The `/slice` command automatically detects whether you're analyzing:
- **One feature** ‚Üí Focused analysis (~10-12 min default, ~15-20 min --full)
- **Multiple features** ‚Üí Project analysis (~30-40 min default, ~45-60 min --full)

**Flags:**
- No flags: Core analysis only (faster, focused)
- `--with-paths`: Adds implementation path options
- `--with-guide`: Adds decision framework
- `--full`: Complete analysis with all sections

### Analysis Workflow

**Core Analysis (always performed):**
1. **Feature Breakdown** - Identifies all features in user journey
2. **Steps Analysis** - Decomposes into UI ‚Üí Logic ‚Üí Data steps
3. **Increments Generation** - Creates 5-10 deployable increments per step
4. **Walking Skeleton** - Suggests absolute minimum implementation
5. **Selection Matrix** - Complete catalog for custom paths

**Optional Analysis (with flags):**
6. **Implementation Paths** (--with-paths or --full) - 3-5 options
7. **Decision Framework** (--with-guide or --full) - Priority recommendations

### Example Output Structure

**Default output:**
```markdown
# Your Feature - Vertical Slicing Analysis

## 1. Executive Summary
[Quick stats and metrics]

## 2. Feature Breakdown
[Complete steps and increments]

## 3. Walking Skeleton
[Minimum implementation with rationale]

## 4. Selection Matrix
[All increments with effort/value/risk scores]
```

**With --full flag:**
```markdown
[... same as above, plus:]

## 5. Implementation Paths
- Speed to Market (2-4 days)
- Balanced Approach (5-8 days)
- Quality First (10-15 days)

## 6. Decision Guide
[How to choose based on priorities]

## 7. Next Steps
[Actionable guidance]
```

## üí° Key Features

### Intelligent Scope Detection
- Automatically identifies single feature vs project
- No need to choose between different commands
- Adapts analysis depth to your needs

### Walking Skeleton Composition
- Selects simplest increments across all steps
- Guarantees end-to-end functionality
- Answers: "What would we ship if deadline was tomorrow?"

### Multiple Implementation Paths
- **Speed:** Fastest to next deployment
- **Balanced:** Speed + quality mix
- **Quality:** Polished experience
- **Feature-by-Feature:** Complete one feature at a time (projects)
- **Cross-Feature:** Improve one aspect across all features (projects)

### Decision Support
- Priority-based recommendations
- Pros/cons for each path
- Real-world scenarios
- Red flags and anti-patterns

### Custom Path Building
- Selection matrix with all increments
- Effort/value/risk scoring
- Visual indicators (‚≠ê‚ö°üî•‚ö†Ô∏èüíé)
- Sprint planning guidance

### Professional Documentation
- Markdown format
- Shareable with team
- Ready for implementation
- Version controlled

## üéì Methodology

### Hamburger Method

Every slice must:
- ‚úÖ Answer: **"What would we ship if the deadline was tomorrow?"**
- ‚úÖ Cut through all technical layers (UI ‚Üí Logic ‚Üí Data)
- ‚úÖ Deliver real, observable value to the user
- ‚úÖ Build the smallest that works, not the "best" version first
- ‚úÖ Can be deployed independently
- ‚úÖ Enable early feedback

### Breakdown Strategies

20+ strategies including:
- Start with outputs
- Zero/One/Many progression
- Dummy to dynamic
- Workflow simplification
- User segment narrowing
- Capacity-based splitting
- And more...
