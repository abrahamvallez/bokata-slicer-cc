# Claude Code Prompts

[![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0)

A collection of specialized prompts and agents for software development using **Augmented Coding** techniques.

## What is Augmented Coding?

**Augmented Coding** is a new programming paradigm that transcends simple "coding by vibes" to create a collaborative workflow between developers and AI. As Kent Beck explains in his article ["Augmented Coding: Beyond the Vibes"](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/augmented-coding-beyond-the-vibes), this approach:

- **Prioritizes code quality** over simple system behavior
- **Maintains human control** while leveraging AI speed
- **Reduces "yak shaving"** (tedious setup work)
- **Enables more strategic programming decisions** per hour
- **Transforms programmers** into strategic architects who guide code generation with expertise and vision

## Repository Contents

This repository contains specialized prompts and agents designed to implement Augmented Coding techniques in different aspects of software development:

### üçî Vertical Slicing (`agents/vertical-slicer/`)

Collection of agents specialized in decomposing complex features using the **Hamburger Method** and radical vertical slicing techniques:

- **Strategic planning** of functionalities in minimal viable increments
- **Systematic decomposition** of features into independent and deployable slices
- **Structured methodology** that guarantees early value delivery

## Project Philosophy

These prompts are designed following Augmented Coding principles:

1. **Detailed and specific prompts** that guide AI toward high-quality results
2. **Modular structures** that allow human intervention and control
3. **Focus on architecture** rather than manual implementation
4. **Clear separation** between structural and behavioral changes
5. **Reuse and specialization** of expert knowledge

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Access to Claude Code or similar AI development tool
- Basic understanding of agile methodologies and iterative development

### Implementation

1. **Select the appropriate agent** for your use case
2. **Customize the context** with your project details
3. **Actively guide the process** by intervening when necessary
4. **Maintain control** over important architectural decisions
