## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-27

### ðŸŽ¯ Major Features Added

#### Dependency and Compatibility System (BREAKING CHANGE - Internal)
The entire vertical slicing system now operates with explicit dependency tracking:

- **Every Increment Specifies:**
  - `REQUIRES`: External dependencies (backend endpoints, services, data availability, or "None")
  - `PROVIDES`: Capabilities offered to other steps (UI components, data, state, API endpoints)
  - `COMPATIBLE WITH`: Which increments from other steps work together

#### Automatic Compatibility Validation
- **Path Composer** now validates that selected increments are mutually compatible
- Detects incompatible combinations and suggests alternatives
- Ensures Walking Skeleton is always a valid, deployable configuration

#### Coordinated Implementation Paths
- Multiple valid end-to-end (E2E) implementation paths are automatically identified
- Each path uses mutually compatible increments across all features
- Paths can be mixed and customized while maintaining compatibility

#### Transparent Dependency Analysis
- Generated documents now include "Dependency Analysis" section
- Shows REQUIRES/PROVIDES/COMPATIBLE WITH clearly for each increment
- Displays compatibility maps showing which increments work together

### Changed

#### increment-generator-specialist.md
- âœ… New "INCREMENT SPECIFICATION FORMAT" section
- âœ… Output now includes REQUIRES/PROVIDES/COMPATIBLE WITH for every increment
- âœ… Added concrete examples (UI Form Layer, Backend API Layer, Data Storage Layer)
- âœ… New QUALITY CRITERIA validating dependency specifications
- âœ… Enhanced TROUBLESHOOTING with coordination guidance

#### path-composer-specialist.md
- âœ… New "Dependency Validation" step (Step 3.5)
- âœ… New "Compatibility Validation" step (Step 3.4)
- âœ… Output format updated with Requires | Provides | Status columns
- âœ… New "Dependency Analysis" section in output
- âœ… New "Compatibility Map" showing working increments
- âœ… Updated examples showing dependency coordination
- âœ… Enhanced validation checklist with compatibility checks

#### doc-generator.md
- âœ… Increments table format updated to show dependencies
- âœ… Columns changed from "# | Name | Depends | Strategy | Notes" to "# | Name | Requires | Provides | Compatible With | Notes"
- âœ… Updated DOCUMENT QUALITY CRITERIA to reflect new format
- âœ… Restructured core sections to ensure consistency

#### feature-analyzer.md
- âœ… Streamlined Phase 3 to focus on core analysis
- âœ… Removed redundant optional phases from core flow
- âœ… Fixed output format consistency

#### project-analyzer.md
- âœ… Enhanced cross-feature coordination
- âœ… Improved dependency tracking for multi-feature projects

### Fixed

- âœ… Walking Skeleton selections are now guaranteed to be compatible
- âœ… Incompatible increment combinations are detected and flagged with alternatives
- âœ… Zero-dependency paths are clearly identified
- âœ… Cross-feature dependencies are explicitly tracked

### Added

- âœ… CHANGELOG.md (this file)
- âœ… agents/bokata-slicer/README.md - Comprehensive agent documentation
- âœ… examples/ folder with sample analyses
- âœ… Dependency system explained in all relevant documentation files

### Documentation Updates

- **README.md**: New section "ðŸ”— Dependency and Compatibility System"
- **CLAUDE.md**: New section "Dependency and Compatibility System (NEW)"
- **INSTALL.md**: Enhanced verification with dependency system checks
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Guidelines for working with dependencies

## Version Comparison

### 0.1.0 â†’ 0.2.0

| Aspect | 0.1.0 | 0.2.0 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Increments | Generated independently | With REQUIRES/PROVIDES/COMPATIBLE WITH |
| Dependency tracking | Implicit | Explicit |
| Compatibility validation | Manual | Automatic |
| Implementation paths | Suggested | Guaranteed valid |
| Documentation | Basic | Includes dependency analysis |

---

## Upgrade Guide

### From 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

No breaking changes for users! The system is backward compatible.

**What's New:**
- Generated documents now include explicit dependency information
- Walking Skeleton selections are automatically validated
- Multiple valid implementation paths are clearly identified

**Installation:**
```bash
npm update increments-slicer
```

**Testing:**
Try the `/slice` command and notice the new dependency information in the output.

## Known Limitations

- Dependency system assumes increment specifications are complete and accurate
- Circular dependency detection focuses on direct circular patterns
- Compatibility validation is syntactic (checks specified lists) not semantic

## Roadmap

### Planned for 0.3.0

- [ ] Graphical visualization of dependency graphs
- [ ] Interactive path selection tool
- [ ] Integration with issue tracking systems (GitHub, Jira)
- [ ] Cost analysis based on effort/value/risk
- [ ] Team collaboration features

### Future Considerations

- Multi-language support
- Custom strategy definitions
- Machine learning for effort estimation
- Real-time collaboration
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
