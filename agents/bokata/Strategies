# BREAKDOWN STRATEGIES REFERENCE

This file contains the full breakdown strategies toolkit.
Reference this when you need detailed strategy explanations.

## Start with the outputs
Focus on **delivering specific outputs incrementally** rather than splitting by technical inputs.

## Workflow Simplification
- Remove optional steps
- Reduce validations
- Skip confirmations
- Example: "Direct purchase" → "Add to cart then purchase"

## Zero/One/Many
- Build for zero → one → many cases
- Example: "No results handling" → "Single result" → "Multiple results with pagination"

## Business Rule Progression
- Implement simplest rule first
- Add constraints incrementally
- Example: "Fixed price" → "Tiered pricing" → "Dynamic pricing"

## Data Variation Reduction
- Start with one data type
- Single format first
- Example: "Text only" → "Text + Images" → "All media types"

## User Segment Narrowing
- Most specific user group first
- Example: "Beta users in London" → "All UK users" → "Global users"

## Use Case Isolation
- Most common scenario first
- Example: "Search by name" → "Search with filters" → "Advanced search"

## Forget the walking skeleton – put it on crutches
- Deliver minimal user-facing functionality with simpler back-end initially
- Build full architecture iteratively later

## Narrow down the customer segment
- Deliver full functionality for **smaller, specific group** first
- Useful when perceived basic functionality is large

## Split by examples of usefulness
- List concrete examples of technical change usefulness
- Identify examples deliverable with **subset of full solution**
- Turn into separate stories

## Split by capacity
- Limit scope by system capacity (file size, users, data volume)
- Deliver for lower capacity first
- Example: "10 items" → "1000 items" → "Unlimited"

## Start with dummy, then move to dynamic
- Build interface/workflow with **hard-coded data** first
- Follow up with real data integration
- Example: "Fixed list" → "Editable list" → "API-driven list"

## Simplify outputs
- Reduce complexity of output formats initially
- Ensure simplified output still provides value
- Example: "Plain text" → "CSV" → "PDF" → "Interactive dashboard"

## Split learning from earning
- Separate research into time-boxed **learning stories**
- **Earning stories** focus on delivering user value

## Extract basic utility
- Deliver **bare minimum functionality** for task completion
- Prioritize basic utility, refine usability later
- Example: "Command line" → "Basic form" → "Rich UI"

## SPIDR Pattern Analysis
- **Spikes**: Separate technical exploration
- **Paths**: Different user paths through story
- **Interfaces**: Different UI approaches
- **Data**: Different data types/sources
- **Rules**: Different business rules

## Coordinating Conjunctions (and, or, but, yet, nor...)
- If story says "X and Y" → likely two stories
- Example: "upload and download files" → split into two

## Action-Related Connectors (manage, handle, support, process, maintain...)
- Generic verbs hide multiple actions
- "Manage users" → "create", "edit", "delete" users

## Sequence Connectors (before, after, then, while, during, when...)
- Indicates process with multiple steps/phases
- Example: "save work before submitting" → two stories

## Scope Indicators (including, as-well-as, along with, also, additionally...)
- Introduce extra requirements that can be separated
- Example: "email and SMS notifications" → two stories

## Option Indicators (either/or, whether, alternatively, optionally...)
- Multiple paths/features, each can be story
- Example: "password or Google login" → two stories

## Exception Indicators (except, unless, however, although, despite...)
- Point to edge cases or special rules
- Example: "delete account unless admin" → split rules

## STRATEGY SELECTION GUIDE

**When to use each:**

- **Zero/One/Many**: Data handling, collections, user management
- **Dummy→Dynamic**: External integrations, API-driven features
- **Workflow Simplify**: Complex multi-step processes
- **Capacity Limits**: Performance-critical features
- **User Segment**: Phased rollouts, beta testing
- **Output Simplify**: Reporting, export features
- **Extract Basic Utility**: MVP, tight deadlines
